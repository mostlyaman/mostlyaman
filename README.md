- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mostlyaman
- :heart: Python is my only friend.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things by practical applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to contribute to open-source.
- ðŸŒŽ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on saving the planet.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? I'd prefer if you would not (socialy awkward *cough cough*). But we can talk on email @ amansharma110603@outlook.com
