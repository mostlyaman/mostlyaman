- 👋 Hi, I’m @mostlyaman
- :heart: Python is my only friend.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things by practical applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to contribute to open-source.
- 🌎 I’m looking to collaborate on saving the planet.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'd prefer if you would not come to my house. But we can talk on email @ amansharma110603@outlook.com
